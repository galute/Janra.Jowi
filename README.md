Java HTTP self hosting framework. The idea is to configure pipelines to handle HTTP requests in a similar way to the .net OWIN framework.

This basically works but it has limited capability. It has no security yet, or robustness around any interrupted or slow network traffic. Many elements of HTTP still need to be added but it does work - see the examples.
